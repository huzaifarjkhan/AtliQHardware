# AtliQHardware
AtliQ Hardware was facing drastic fall in revenue and profit in the year 2020.
Hence, they wanted to have a Fully Interactive and insightful dashboard to monitor their sales, customers and profits closely. 

# Defining AIMS Grid
First step in this analysis was to define an objective and unbias AIMS grid.

After communication with the Sales Director (Primary Stakeholder) and other stake holders (including company's Data engineers) an AIMS grid was defined as follows:

  -- # PURPOSE
          To unlock sales insights that are not visible now - to sales team, and automate them to reduce manual time time spent in data gathering
  -- # STAKEHOLDERS
          * Sales Director
          * Marketing Team
          * Data & Analytics Team
          * IT
  -- # END RESULT
          An automated dashboard providing quick and latest sales insights in order to support data-driven decision making
  -- # SUCCESS CRITERIA
          * Dashboard(s) uncovering sales order insights with the latest data available
          * Sales Analyst stops data gathering manually in order to save 20% of their business time and reinvest it in value added activities
